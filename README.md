Discord Logs is a powerful package which add many useful events to your Discord.js client!

**Warning**: This package uses recent Discord.js features and only works on v12 or higher (`npm install discordjs/discord.js`).

```js
const Discord = require('discord.js');
const client = new Discord.Client();
const logs = require('discord-logs');
logs(client);

// Access to new events, like guildMemberBoost!
client.on('guildMemberBoost', (member) => {
    console.log(`${member.user.tag} just boosted ${member.guild.name}!`);
});

client.login('YOUR_DISCORD_BOT_TOKEN');
```
